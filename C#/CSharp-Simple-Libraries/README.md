## CSHARP-SIMPLE-LIBRARIES

Welcome to my C# learning repository! Here, I've compiled snippets of small programs that I created while mastering C# (as someone who already knew C++ really well). Each file represents a different concept or feature of C# that I've learned. Please note, the content here showcases my learning journey and should serve as an indicator of the breadth of knowledge I've gained, which has since been significantly expanded upon.

## Learning Highlights

- [`CharSet.cs`](CharSet.cs): Explored the use of collections and string manipulation, learning about character encodings and operations in C#.
- [`Extensions.cs`](Extensions.cs): Delved into extension methods, enhancing the functionality of existing data types and understanding the power of static classes.
- [`Functions.cs`](Functions.cs): Focused on delegates, events, and lambda expressions, getting a grasp on the event-driven programming paradigm and anonymous methods.
- [`MyDictionary.cs`](MyDictionary.cs): Implemented a custom dictionary, deepening my understanding of generics.
- [`MyPair.cs`](MyPair.cs): Created a simple generic class to understand tuples and their utility in creating type-safe data structures.
- [`Shapes.cs`](Shapes.cs): Worked with inheritance and polymorphism, crafting a hierarchy of shape classes to represent geometric concepts.
- [`SingleSequenceProcessors.cs`](SingleSequenceProcessors.cs): Learned about LINQ and the functional programming aspects of C#, applying them to sequence processing.
- [`UniqueSet.cs`](UniqueSet.cs): Developed a custom set collection.

This repository is a snapshot of my initial learning process. It reflects the foundational understanding of C# I've built, which has been the cornerstone of my continued growth in more complex projects and applications.

## Moving Forward

I've continued to advance my knowledge and skills in C#, tackling more complex projects. While the code in this repository is rudimentary, it laid the groundwork for the advanced work I do now, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges and continue learning.
