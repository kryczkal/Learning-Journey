# C++ SIMPLE EXAMPLES

This repository is a chronicle of my journey through the fascinating world of C++, captured during the early to middle stages of my learning. Herein lie the projects that expanded my understanding of C++ beyond the basics.

## What I Learned

- **STL and Website Simulation**: Dived deep into the Standard Template Library (STL), grasping the intricacies of containers, iterators, and algorithms. These concepts were applied in simulating website data management, enhancing my practical understanding of STL in real-world scenarios.
- **Student Grading System**: Implemented a system handling student grades, honing my skills in class design, file I/O, and data management. This project solidified my grasp of object-oriented programming and complex data structures.
- **English-Polish Dictionary**: Created a bilingual dictionary application for learning new vocabulary. It was a departure from the heavy STL focus of other projects.

This selection of projects exemplifies the growth of my capabilities in C++, setting the foundation for the advanced topics I now navigate with ease. Feel free to delve into the code, and see the stepping stones of my development in this powerful programming language.

## Beyond This Repository

Since these projects, I've delved into more advanced areas of C++, including concurrent programming, advanced memory management, WinApi and more.
