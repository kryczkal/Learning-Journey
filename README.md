# Learning-Journey

Welcome to my central repository of learning and development in programming. This is a comprehensive exhibit of my skills, projects, and progress in different languages and concepts. Each sub-repository represents a step in my journey towards mastering the art of code.

## Overview

- [x] **[C#](./CSharp/CSharp-Simple-Libraries)**: Contains foundational C# projects showcasing my grasp of .NET collections, extension methods, and custom data structures.
- [x] **[C++/Cpp-Simple-Examples](./C++/Cpp-Simple-Examples/)**: Features early to mid-journey C++ programs, including STL usage.
- [x] **[C++/Hanoi Tower](C++/Hanoi-Tower)**: A sophisticated solution to the Hanoi Tower problem using advanced C++ concepts.
- [x] **[C-Posix-Operating-Systems](./C-Posix-Operating-Systems)**: Delves into low-level system programming with C and POSIX APIs.
- [x] **[Matlab-Numerical-Recipes](./Matlab-Numerical-Recipes)**: Demonstrates numerical methods in Matlab.
- [x] **[Python/TalkTales](./Python/TalkTales)**: Speech diarization tool made using Gaussian Mixutre Models and open source solutions.
- [x] **[Python/SnakeAI](./Python/SnakeAI)**: A game of snake played by a DQN network.  
- [ ] **Data Structures in Cpp** <- partially implemented, but not yet public.
- [ ] **Graph Algorithms in C#** <- this is a topic I am currently exploring and a new repository should soon be visible.
- [ ] **WinApi in Cpp** <- another topic/technology I am currently learning and will soon be visible in this repository.
- [ ] **Object Oriented Programming** I am also currently learning how to design well-thought-out easily expandible (open for expansion/closed for modification) applications, and use common programming paradigms (Adapter/AbstractFactory/Singleton etc), and am expanding a project that will soon also be avaliable here.

Each subdirectory is a window into the skills I've honed, with projects that range from simple to complex, reflecting my learning process, current capabilities and things that I will soon know as I am currently learning them.

## Intent

The purpose of this repository is to provide a transparent, detailed view of my evolving expertise as a software developer. It is crafted to present my dedication to learning, problem-solving skills, and my ability to tackle complex concepts with clarity and precision.

I am always eager to discuss these projects and welcome any feedback or inquiries regarding potential opportunities.
