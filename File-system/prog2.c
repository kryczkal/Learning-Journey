/*
 * This program demonstrates the use of the nftw (new file tree walk) function to traverse directories and their subdirectories, counting and printing information about each entry encountered.
 * It operates on directories specified as command-line arguments. For each directory, it applies two main functions:
 *   - printNode: This function is called for each entry in the directory tree. It prints the entry's type (directory, file, symlink, or other) and name, with indentation corresponding to the entry's depth in the directory tree. The indentation is dynamically calculated to visually represent the directory structure.
 *   - countNode: Although defined, it's not used in the main logic but is intended to count the types of entries (directories, files, symbolic links, and others) encountered during the traversal.
 * 
 * The traversal is performed in a physical manner (FTW_PHYS flag), meaning that symbolic links to directories are not followed, to avoid potentially infinite loops in the presence of circular links.
 * 
 * Error handling is done through the ERR macro for critical errors, and a check is included after the nftw call to catch any permissions-related issues during the traversal.
 * 
 * The program demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for creating indented strings and extracting filenames from paths, as well as the use of the nftw function for complex directory traversal tasks.
 * 
 * Note: The countNode function is set up for demonstration but not actively used in the program's main logic. Instead, the program focuses on visually representing the directory structure and the types of entries within it.
